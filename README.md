# homebrew-images

## Optional: install tap


```bash
$ brew tap germaniakg/images
```

From [brew docs:](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/brew-tap.md) After that, `brew` will be able to work on those formulae as if they were in Homebrew's canonical repository. You can install and uninstall them with `brew [un]install`, and the formulae are automatically updated when you run brew update.
